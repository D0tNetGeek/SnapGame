# SnapGame

A two player Snap card game.

A standard pack of 52 cards is shuffled and then dealt out equally among the players in face-down  stacks 
(any  remaining cards  are  discarded).  Play  proceeds  with  the  players taking it in turns to remove a card from the top of 
their stack and place it face-up on a central pile. 

If two cards placed consecutively on the pile have the same number value (e.g. 2 queens) then players must shout "Snap!" and 
place their hand on the top of the central pile. The first player who "snaps" the cards takes the cards from the central pile and 
adds them to the bottom of their own stack. The player who accumulates all of the cards in this way wins the game.
